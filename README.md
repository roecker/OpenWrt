OpenWrt
=======

Additional packages I need for my OpenWrt based systems.

apu_led_and_switch
------------------

Add LED and switch-button support for the APU-Boards from PC-Engines. Source
comes from http://daduke.org/linux/apu/. I just put it in this package. Works
fine for me.


DHCP-Forwarder
--------------

This package was available in Attitude Adjustment and maybe in Barrier Breaker
(i skipped this version so I don't know). I took the Makefile and updated it to
the latest version which I'm now using.


LibreSwan - VPN software
------------------------

Libreswan for OpenWrt. I use libreswan with klips instead of netkey at the
moment.
See https://libreswan.org/ for more information.


NSS - Network Security Services
-------------------------------

NSS with NSPR (Netscape Portable Runtime) support for OpenWrt.
