OpenWrt
=======

Additional packages I need for my OpenWrt based systems.

NSS - Network Security Services
-------------------------------

NSS with NSPR (Netscape Portable Runtime) support for OpenWrt.
see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS



LibreSwan - VPN software
------------------------

Libreswan for OpenWrt. I use libreswan with klips instead of netkey at the
moment.
See https://libreswan.org/ for more information.
